# Python Data Structures Exercises

Welcome to the Python Data Structures Exercises project! This Python project contains a collection of programs demonstrating fundamental data structures and their operations using Python.

#### By **George Badia**

This project was created and is the sole property of Your Name.

## Project Overview

The Python Data Structures Exercises project includes five Python programs that demonstrate the use of various data structures:

- **List Sum Program**: Accepts user input to create a list of integers and computes their sum.
- **Favorite Books Tuple**: Stores and displays a tuple of favorite book names.
- **Person Dictionary**: Stores and displays information about a person using a dictionary.
- **Set Intersection Program**: Creates two sets of integers from user input and finds their common elements.
- **Odd Length Words**: Uses list comprehension to filter words with an odd number of characters.

### Key Features

- Input validation for integer inputs.
- Demonstrates use of lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, and list comprehensions.
- Simple and clear console-based user interaction.

## Features

- **List Management**: Create and sum a list of integers with input validation.
- **Tuple Iteration**: Display book names stored in a tuple using a for loop.
- **Dictionary Operations**: Store and retrieve person information with user input.
- **Set Operations**: Find common elements between two sets created from user input.
- **List Comprehension**: Filter words based on character length criteria.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

- Linux, macOS, or WSL for Windows users
- Visual Studio Code or any preferred IDE
- GitHub account
- Python 3.x

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
